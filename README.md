A JavaScript-like nested object-like structure non-fallible path access interface.

This library permits the user to access values in nested structures trough the use
of `get` methods that return `Option<T>`. This may be used to access specific API data
without serializing it into multiple structures and making a mess.

## Use Cases üîç

Imagine you just accessed a song API, this API describes everything you may or may not
want to know about a specific song or songs. With the help of computed indexes you can
access the same path multiple times in a variable way.

Lets try it.

```rust
use serde_json::Value as JsonValue;
use reqwest::get;
use dyn_path::dyn_access;

let response = get("https://api.platform-ending-with-fy.com/v1/tracks/5cbpoIu3YjoOwbBDGUEp3P")
	.await?
	.json::<JsonValue>()
	.await?;

let song_name = dyn_access!(response.album.name);
let song_main_artist = dyn_access!(response.album.artists[0].name);

assert_eq!(song_name, "Car Radio");
assert_eq!(song_main_artist, "Twenty One Pilots");
```

Obviously this isn't a real call to a real API, but the intention can be inferred from
this example anyways.

## Installation üì¶

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` under the `dependencies` section

```toml
dyn_path = "1.0.7"
```

## No std üí°

This crate supports `no_std`, meaning you can use it in your project without
depending on specific system I/O or anything else.

The crate has a default feature enabled which is `std`, with this feature
the crate doesn't really use `std` but it pre-includes `alloc` which
permits the use of the `dyn_path` macro, which uses `String` to describe
a path.

You can also disable the default features and the crate will annotate `no_std`.
Then use the `alloc` feature if you want to have the `dyn_path` macro enabled.
